**dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**. At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) 
[CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant HTML 
layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer: it will 
download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style attributes 
of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational HTML attributes.

Features
========
 * handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media & @page rules
 * supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
 * supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via fopen-wrappers)
 * supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed border models, individual cell styling
 * image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
 * no dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
 * inline PHP support
 
Requirements
============
 * PHP 5.0+ (5.3 recommended)
 * MBString extension
 * DOM extension (bundled with PHP 5)
 * Some fonts. PDFs internally support Helvetica, Times-Roman, Courier & Zapf-Dingbats, but if you wish to use other fonts you will need to install some fonts. dompdf supports the same fonts as the underlying R&OS PDF class: Type 1 (.pfb with the corresponding .afm) and TrueType (.ttf). At the minimum, you should probably have the Microsoft core fonts. See the font installation instructions.

Installation
============

DOMPDF can be installed manually, or using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

To install with Composer, simply add the requirement to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "dompdf/dompdf": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

And run Composer to update your dependencies:

    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar update
    
Before you can use DOMPDF in your application, you must manually include its configuration file, like so:

```php
// disable DOMPDF's internal autoloader if you are using Composer
define('DOMPDF_ENABLE_AUTOLOAD', false);

// set any other configuration variables you need here
define('DOMPDF_LOG_OUTPUT_FILE', false);

// include DOMPDF's default configuration
require_once '/path/to/vendor/dompdf/dompdf/dompdf_config.inc.php';
```

Limitations (Known Issues)
==========================
 * not particularly tolerant to poorly-formed HTML input (using Tidy first may help).
 * large files or large tables can take a while to render
 * CSS float is not supported (but is in the works).
 * If you find this project useful, please consider making a donation.
